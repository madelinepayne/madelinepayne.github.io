    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>I am a junior from London, UK (dual citizen UK/US) pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Tufts University in Boston, MA. I will be interning at Apple Inc. beginning in June 2018, as part of the Apple Watch team.</p>
        <p>In Summer 2017 I pursued an Software Engineering Internship at JauntVR in California and features I implemented went out in a build release on July 7, hopefully with more to come. I also took part in the company Hackathon, you can see my project under Code Samples or in my Resume. I was able to do an independent project where I implemented a video controls UI within the Jaunt Player project using the Oculus Rift PC SDK.</p>
        <p>At Tufts I am the Executive Sports Editor of the Tufts Daily. I have spent the semester overseeing 30 writers and 8 editors, and curating content 5 days a week to be published. I trained more than 20 new writers, all of whom wrote articles that were published over the course of the semester. The section published 14 features in total on top of our regular recaps (the most ever in one semester). I am immensely proud of my work at the Daily this Fall.</p>
            <p>I was Treasurer for the Association of Multiracial People until March, a club that I have significant emotional investment in, and I play club lacrosse. In Fall 2015 and Spring 2017 I was named to the Dean's List, and in Spring 2016 nominated to attend the Annual Developing Leaders Conference.</p>
        <p>Academically, I speak Chinese to college fourth-year level, have extensive knowledge of European history, a good fundamental understanding of molecular and ecosystem biology, and chemistry, and have taken numerous Computer Science classes. </p>
        <p>My main passion in high school was Young Enterprise, a program where high school students design, manufacture, and sell a product with little guidance. Our success culminated in a ten-page company report that I put together, which the team was awarded Best Company Report in West London for. It was during this activity that I realized my passion for organization and entrepreneurship.</p>
