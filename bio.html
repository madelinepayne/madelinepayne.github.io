        <p>I am a sophomore from London, UK majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies at Tufts University in Boston, MA. Having moved to London from Palo Alto, CA at the age of 8, I was integrated into the British education system where I sat GCSE examinations in Year 11 and International Baccaleaureate examinations in Year 13.</p>
        <p>My main passion in high school was Young Enterprise, a program where high school students design, manufacture, and sell a product with little guidance. Our success culminated in a ten-page company report that I put together, which the team was awarded Best Company Report in West London for. It was during this activity that I realized my passion for organization and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>At Tufts I am Treasurer for the Association of Multiracial People, a club that I have significant emotional investment in, and I play club lacrosse. In Fall 2015 I was named to the Dean's List, and in Spring 2016 nominated to attend the Annual Developing Leaders Conference.</p>
        <p>Academically, I speak Chinese to college fourth-year level, have extensive knowledge of European history, a good fundamental understanding of molecular and ecosystem biology, and chemistry, and have taken several Computer Science classes. </p>
        <p>Currently I am working on a solo web project that will allow users to track what movies they have watched over their lifetime, something that my younger brother has asked me to make for a long time.
