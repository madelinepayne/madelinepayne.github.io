<span style="color: #557799">###Purpose</span>
The program should be able to read in files of students and TAs and carry out
several commands. Ls should list all courses taken by any students, ls should
list all students, taed <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;student name&quot;</span> should list all courses that a student
has taed, roster <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;course ID&quot;</span> should list all the students who have taken a 
particular course, paths <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;student a&quot;</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;student b&quot;</span> should list all the paths
between the two students, shortest path <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;student a&quot;</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;student b&quot;</span> should list the 
shortest path between the two students.

<span style="color: #557799">###List of files</span>
<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">Person:</span> Person is a class that is designed to hold all the relevant information
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">for</span> one person. These things are their name, the classes they<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>ve taken, and the
classes they<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>ve TA<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>d. Every person, regardless of whether they are in the TA 
file or Student file have their own instance of a person class because many
people both attended and ta<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>d classes. I have a global list of all people that 
is created in main after I read in the two files.

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">Course:</span> Course is a class that is designed to hold all the relevant information
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">for</span> one course. These things are the course ID, the roster, and the list of TAs.
I have a global list of all courses that is created in main after I read in 
the two files.

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">StudentList:</span> StudentList holds the master list of all people (students or TAs)
and the relevant functions. Instances of this class are used to model the lists
of students in each Course that make up the roster and TA list. This is because
it makes it easier to have several lists rather than having individual dynamic
arrays that each need their own counts and their own expand functions. 

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">CourseList:</span> Courselist holds the master list of all courses and the relevant 
functions. Instances of this class are used within each Person to model the list
of all classes they<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>ve ever attended or TA<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>d. Used <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">for</span> the same reasons as 
described in StudentList.

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">Path:</span> Path contains the PathElement <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">struct</span> which has a Person pointer and 
Course pointer. This is so that depending on what type it is in the path, either
one or the other will be set to <span style="color: #007020">NULL</span>, which obviously indicates with a quick 
check whether something the element is a Person or Course. This is very useful 
when it comes to printing the path, because a Person is printed, followed by a
<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;+-&quot;</span> and then a course followed by a <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;-&gt;&quot;</span> and so the function can easily 
print the proper output by distinguishing whether that element is a Person or
Course.

<span style="color: #557799">###Compile command</span>
use included Makefile or 
main.cpp Course.cpp Person.cpp  StudentList.cpp CourseList.cpp Path.cpp 
Course.h Person.h StudentList.h CourseList.h Path.h

<span style="color: #557799">###Outline of data structure </span>
Students<span style="color: #333333">/</span>TAs<span style="color: #333333">:</span> These are stored in dynamic arrays (either in StudentList or
CourseList) so that they can be fairly easily accessed and easily printed.

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">Courses:</span> These are stored in dynamic arrays too.

<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">Paths:</span> Individual paths are stored in a vector of type PathELement called Path 
because the length of paths vary so much that its just very convenient to be 
able to store in a vector. Vectors also have a built in size accessor function. 
The list of all possible paths is also stored in a vector of type Path that 
obviously expands as needed.

<span style="color: #557799">###Algorithms</span>
<span style="color: #997700; font-weight: bold">find_path:</span> This is made up of two different but similar find_path functions, one
in the Person class and one in the Course class. Essentially you look at the 
person you start with, go into the Courselist of courses taed, look at the first
course in the taed list, go to that roster, and look at the first person in the 
roster. Therefore, this is not a strictly recursive function as it does not
call itself, just calls a very similar function. The program will go between
the Person and Course version of the find_path, adding each Person or Class to
the end of the path that it is building. Each time the other find_path is called
a copy of the current path is passed in <span style="color: #333333">-</span> this is what takes up a lot of 
memory and a lot of time, but I couldn<span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFAAAA">&#39;</span>t find a way around this. One time<span style="color: #333333">-</span>saving
method used was when looking at a roster, first searching <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">for</span> the person in 
mind, and <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> finding it, calling find_path on that person <span style="color: #333333">-</span> thus ending that 
path. However, <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> the person was not immediately found in a roster, each Person
and therefore each of their courses would be examined too. Once the desired 
person is finally found, the path that has been built gets added to the vector
of found_paths. I did not implement <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;marking&quot;</span> in the way we were expressly
taught, but instead implemented a check of whether or not that person was 
already in the path, and <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> not, continuing down that path.
