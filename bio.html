    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>I am a junior from London, UK (dual citizen UK/US) pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Tufts University in Boston, MA. Having moved to London from Palo Alto, CA at the age of 8, I was integrated into the British education system where I sat GCSE examinations in Year 11 and International Baccaleaureate examinations in Year 13.</p>
        <p>In summer 2017 I am pursuing an Software Engineering Internship at JauntVR in California and features I implemented went out in a build release on July 7, hopefully with more to come. I also took part in the company Hackathon, you can see my project under Code Samples or in my Resume.</p>
        <p>At Tufts I am the Executive Sports Editor of the Tufts Daily, and am looking forward to recruiting new writers in September 2017 and producing great content up until the end of the year. I was Treasurer for the Association of Multiracial People until March, a club that I have significant emotional investment in, and I play club lacrosse. In Fall 2015 and Spring 2017 I was named to the Dean's List, and in Spring 2016 nominated to attend the Annual Developing Leaders Conference.</p>
        <p>Academically, I speak Chinese to college fourth-year level, have extensive knowledge of European history, a good fundamental understanding of molecular and ecosystem biology, and chemistry, and have taken numerous Computer Science classes. </p>
         <p>My main passion in high school was Young Enterprise, a program where high school students design, manufacture, and sell a product with little guidance. Our success culminated in a ten-page company report that I put together, which the team was awarded Best Company Report in West London for. It was during this activity that I realized my passion for organization and entrepreneurship.</p>
