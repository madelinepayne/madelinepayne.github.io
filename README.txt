Assignment: Portfolio

I have correctly implemented all three webpages (index,bio,resume) correct 
according to the specifications. I have written corresponding css files for
each html file. 

TODO
I have successfully hosted my index.html in my Tufts account
that redirects to my website on Github. My html pages all pass the official 
HTML5 specification. My css files all pass the official CSS validation.
All my content is stored in my github repo.

I collaborated with Tati Doyle who explained div/classes and how to link css
style sheets to my html file.

I spent 3 hours on this project.
